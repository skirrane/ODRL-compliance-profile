# ODRL-compliance-profile

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services.

The ODRL Regulatory Compliance Profile (orcp) is an early version of the ODRL Compliance Profile, which contains both the ODRL Compliance Profile and the GDPR instantiation. 

In order to impove readability the document was split into the following seperate draft specifications:
(1) The ODRL Compliance Profile (ocp) adapts the ODRL Information Model and ODRL Vocabulary & Expression specifications in order to support automated compliance checking.
(2) The ODRL GDPR Compliance Profile (gdprcp) demonstrates how the ODRL Compliance Profile can be extended to support GDPR compliance checking in particular.
