    	<h2>ODRL Compliance Profile Model</h2>

    	<p>The ODRL Compliance Profile model represents Policies that express Permissions, Prohibitions, Obligations, and Dispensations related to actions.</p>
    	<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Compliance Profile model, which is an adaptation of the ODRL Information model.</p>

    	</figure>

    	<p>The ODRL Compliance Profile model has the following core classes:
        <ul>
          <li><code>Policy</code> - A non-empty <code>Set</code> of <code>Permissions</code> (via the permission property) and/or <code>Prohibitions</code> (via the prohibition property) and/or <code>Obligations</code> (via the obligation property) and/or <code>Dispensations</code> (via the dispensation property).
    			</li>

    	    <li><code>ConflictTerm </code> - A means to specific the conflict resolution strategy.</li>

    			<li><code>Rule</code> - An abstract concept that represents the common characteristics of Permissions, Prohibitions, Obligations and Dispensations.
        	</li>

    			<li><code>Action</code> - An operation referred to in a Rule.
    			</li>

    			<li><code>Resource</code> - An object referred to in a Rule.
    			</li>

    			<li><code>Party</code> - An entity referred to in a Rule.
    			</li>

    			<li><code>Constraint</code> - An abstract concept denoting constraints used to refine a Rule. The profile currently supports <code>PredicateConstraints</code>.

    		<h3>Policy Class</h3>
    		<p>The Policy class has the following properties:</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>A Policy MUST have one <code>uid</code> property value (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the Policy.</li>
    			<li>A Policy MUST have at least one <code>permission</code>, <code>prohibition</code>, <code>obligation</code> or <code>dispensation</code> property of type Rule.

      	<h3>ConflictTerm Class </h3>

      	<p>The <code>conflict</code> property is used to establish strategies to resolve conflicts that arise from the merging of Policies or conflicts between Permissions/Obligations and Prohibitions in the same Policy. Conflicts may arise when merging Policies, as a result of policy inheritance, or when Rules are inconsistent.</p>
      	<p>The <code>conflict</code> property SHOULD take one of the following conflict strategy preference values (instances of the ConflictTerm class):</p>

      	<ul>
      		<li><code>perm</code>: Permissions and Obligations MUST override the Prohibitions</li>
      		<li><code>prohibit</code>: Prohibitions MUST override the Permissions and Obligations</li>
      		<li><code>invalid</code>: the entire Policy MUST be void if any conflict is detected</li>
      	</ul>

      	<p>If the <code>conflict</code> property is not explicitly set, the default of <code>invalid</code> will be used.
      	<p>The conflict strategy requirements include:</p>

      	<ol>
          <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>perm</code> then any conflicting Permission/Obligation Rule MUST override the Prohibition Rule.</li>
       		<li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>prohibit</code> then any conflicting Prohibition Rule MUST override the Permission/Obligation Rule.</li>
        	<li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>invalid</code> then any conflicting Rules MUST void  the entire Policy.</li>
       		<li>If a Policy has multiple <code>conflict</code> property values (for example, after a Policy merge or inheritance) and there are conflicting Rules then the entire Policy MUST be void.</li>

        <p>An <code>Action</code> class indicates an operation. </p>

        <p>The Action class has the following properties:</p>
      	 <ul>
          <li>An Action SHOULD have one <code>uid</code> property value (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the Action.</li>
      	 </ul>

      </section>

      <section id="resource-class">
      	<h3>Resource Class</h3>
      	<p>A <code>Resource</code> class is a resource or a collection of resources that are the subject of a Rule. The Resource can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, services, or physical artefacts.
        <p>The Resource class has the following properties:</p>

      	<ul>
      		<li>A Resource SHOULD have one <code>uid</code> property value (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the Resource.</li>
      	</ul>

      	<section id="hasPolicy">
      		<h4>hasPolicy property</h4>
      		<p>An ODRL Policy class MAY also be referenced by the <code>hasPolicy</code> property. This supports ODRL Policy Rules being the object of external metadata expressions (that identifies a Resource). When <code>hasPolicy</code> has been asserted between a metadata expression and an ODRL Policy, the Resource being identified MUST be inferred to be the <code>resource</code> of all the Rules of that Policy. If there are multiple Rules in the Policy, then the inferred Resource will be the target Resource to <strong>every</strong> Rule in the Policy.</p>

        <p>The Party class has the following properties:</p>

      	<ul>

      	<h3>Constraint Class</h3>
      	<p>The <code>Constraint</code> class is used to specify expressions that can be used to refine the semantics of an Action or declare the conditions applicable to a Rule.

      	<section id="PredicateConstraint-subclass">
      		<h4>PredicateConstraint subClass</h4>
      		<p>A PredicateConstraint class is used for expressions which compare two operands by one relational operator, where the leftOperand is a predicate and the rightOperand is an object. If the comparison returns a match the PredicateConstraint is <strong>satisfied</strong>, otherwise it is <strong>not satisfied</strong>. The Constraint class formulates a comparison expression, such as, ocp:organisationType (the <code>leftOperand</code>) must be equal to (the <code>operator</code>) ocp:InternationalOrganisation (the <code>rightOperand</code>). </p>
      		<p>The Constraint class has the following properties:</p>
